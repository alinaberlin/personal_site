            <p><h3>BIO</h3></p><br>
            <p>
              I have a Bachelor Degree in Accounting but in the last 2 years since moving to Berlin I've
              discovered the beauty of the software industry by attending meetups on different subjects.<br>
              This inspired me to re focus my career and work on becoming a software developer.<br>
              In order to achieve my goal and understand UX principles, I've worked on test applications<br>
              for a large number of companies such as EyeEm(app for photos), Memorando and
              GameDuell(games) Ally(local transport application for mobile), Mimi Hearing.<br>
              I've started to learn programming by attending meetups organised by OpenTechSchool and
              also attending online courses on e-learning platforms like Coursera, Udacity and Code
              Academy.<br>
              Currently I'm eager to become a front-end developer (because I like javascript) and in order
              to achieve this objective I'm looking for an internship or junior developer opportunity.</p><br>
